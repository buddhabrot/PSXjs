Testing uses Google's js-test-driver.

You can download it from http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver

From their documentation:

First run a server with 
    java -jar JsTestDriver.jar --port 9876

Then capture a browser by going to the URL of your JsTestDriver server, if running on localhost it should be:
    http://localhost:9876

You can also tell the server to autocapture the browser by providing a path to the browser exectable on the cammand line. Multiple browsers can be specified if separated by a comma ','.

java -jar JsTestDriver.jar --port 9876 --browser firefoxpath,chromepath

Then run the tests with

java -jar JsTestDriver.jar --tests all

Just read more about js-test-driver if you want to do advanced things.
